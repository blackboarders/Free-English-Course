<b>Topic: </b><br>
Hometown<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
Where is your hometown?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
My hometown is a small coastal city called Brighton, located in the south of England. It's known for its vibrant arts scene, historic pier, and beautiful beach. I’ve lived there for most of my life, and I really enjoy the lively atmosphere, especially during the summer when the city is full of tourists.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Work or Study<br><br>
<b>Question: </b><br>
What do you do for work or study?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I’m currently a software engineer at a tech company. My job involves developing and maintaining software applications, which I find both challenging and rewarding. I also spend a lot of time collaborating with my team to solve complex problems and improve our products.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Weekends<br><br>
<b>Question: </b><br>
How do you usually spend your weekends?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
On weekends, I like to relax and unwind after a busy week. I usually start my day with a morning run, and then I might meet up with friends for coffee or brunch. In the afternoon, I enjoy reading or watching a good movie. Sometimes I also take short trips to nearby places if the weather is nice.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Home<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
Can you describe the home you live in?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I live in a two-bedroom apartment in the city center. It’s a modern building with all the amenities I need, including a gym and a swimming pool. The apartment itself is cozy, with a spacious living room, an open-plan kitchen, and a small balcony that overlooks the park. I love the natural light that comes through the large windows, making the space feel bright and airy.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Free Time<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
What do you usually do in your free time?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, especially mysteries and thrillers. I also like to go for long walks in the park near my house, as it helps me relax and clear my mind. On weekends, I often meet up with friends for coffee or a meal, and we catch up on what’s been happening in our lives. Sometimes I also watch movies or documentaries online, depending on my mood.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Shopping<br><br>
<b>Question: </b><br>
Do you enjoy shopping?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I wouldn’t say I’m a big fan of shopping, but I do enjoy it when I’m in the mood or need something specific. I prefer shopping online because it’s more convenient, and I can easily compare prices and read reviews before making a purchase. However, when it comes to clothes or shoes, I like to go to physical stores so I can try things on and see how they fit.<br><br>

<b>Cue Card Topic: </b><br>
Describe a memorable trip you have taken.<br><br>
You should say:<br>

Where you went<br>
Who you went with<br>
What you did there<br>
And explain why this trip was memorable.<br><br>

<b>Sample Answer:</b><br><br>
One of the most memorable trips I’ve ever taken was to the island of Bali in Indonesia. I went there with two of my closest friends last summer, and it was an amazing experience. We stayed in a beautiful villa near the beach, which was perfect for relaxing and enjoying the stunning views.<br><br>

During our trip, we spent a lot of time exploring the island. We visited several famous temples, including Tanah Lot, which is located on a rock formation in the sea. We also went hiking in the lush green rice terraces of Ubud, which was breathtaking. One of the highlights of the trip was snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters of Nusa Penida, where we saw colorful coral reefs and a variety of marine life.<br><br>

This trip was memorable for several reasons. First, it was my first time visiting Southeast Asia, and I was fascinated by the culture and natural beauty of Bali. Second, I got to spend quality time with my friends, and we created so many wonderful memories together. Lastly, the trip was a great opportunity to unwind and escape the stresses of everyday life, which left me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.<br><br>


<b>Cue Card Topic: </b><br>
Describe a person who has influenced you in your life.<br><br>
You should say:<br>

Who this person is<br>
How you know this person<br>
What this person has done to influence you<br>
And explain why this person is important to you.<br><br>

<b>Sample Answer:</b><br><br>

One person who has greatly influenced me in my life is my high school English teacher, Mrs. Johnson. I first met her when I was in the 10th grade, and she immediately stood out as someone who was passionate about her subject and genuinely cared about her students.<br><br>

Mrs. Johnson had a unique teaching style that made learning English enjoyable and engaging. She encouraged us to think critically, express our opinions, and develop our writing skills. She often went beyond the standard curriculum, introducing us to literature from different cultures and time periods, which opened my eyes to the world of literature and its power to convey complex ideas and emotions.<br><br>

What really influenced me was her belief in my potential. She saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself at the time, and she pushed me to challenge myself, whether it was through writing essays, participating in debates, or simply expressing my thoughts more clearly. Her encouragement and guidance helped me develop confidence in my abilities, not just in English but in all areas of my life.<br><br>

Mrs. Johnson is important to me because she played a significant role in shaping the person I am today. Her influence has stayed with me long after I left high school, and I often find myself reflecting on the lessons she taught me, both academic and personal. She’s someone I’ll always remember with deep gratitude.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Travel and Tourism<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
What are the benefits of traveling?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
Traveling offers numerous benefits. One of the main advantages is that it allows people to experience new cultures and learn about different ways of life. This can broaden their perspectives and make them more open-minded. Additionally, travel provides an opportunity to relax and take a break from daily routines, which can help reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Finally, traveling can create lasting memories and strengthen relationships, whether you’re traveling with family, friends, or even on your own.<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
How has tourism changed in your country over the last decade?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
In the last decade, tourism in my country has grown significantly, especially in major cities and popular tourist destinations. There’s been a noticeable increase in the number of international visitors, which has led to the development of new hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Additionally, social media has played a huge role in promoting lesser-known places, which has encouraged more people to explore different parts of the country. However, this increase in tourism has also brought challenges, such as overcrowding and environmental concerns, which need to be managed carefully.<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
Do you think people will travel more or less in the future?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I believe that people will continue to travel more in the future, particularly as the world becomes more connected and travel becomes more affordable. Advances in technology and transportation will make it easier for people to explore new places, and the growing popularity of remote work might encourage more people to take extended trips or combine work with travel. However, concerns about sustainability and the environmental impact of travel could lead to changes in how people travel, with more emphasis on eco-friendly tourism and slower, more meaningful travel experiences.<br><br>

<b>Topic: </b><br>
Role Models<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
What qualities do you think are important in a role model?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I believe that a good role model should possess qualities such as integrity, perseverance, and empathy. Integrity is crucial because a role model should be someone who consistently does what is right, even when it’s difficult. Perseverance is important because it shows that they can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, which can inspire others to do the same. Empathy is also essential, as it allows them to understand and relate to the experiences of others, making them more approachable and relatable.<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
Do you think young people today have fewer role models than in the past?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
I don’t necessarily think that young people have fewer role models today, but the nature of role models has changed. In the past, role models were often people in one’s immediate community, such as teachers, parents, or local leaders. Nowadays, with the influence of social media and the internet, young people are exposed to a wider range of potential role models, including celebrities, influencers, and public figures from all over the world. While this offers more options, it also means that role models can sometimes be chosen for superficial reasons rather than their true character or achievements.<br><br>

<b>Question: </b><br>
How can parents help their children choose good role models?<br><br>
<b>Sample Answer: </b><br>
Parents can play a significant role in helping their children choose good role models by discussing the qualities that make someone a positive influence. They can encourage their children to look beyond fame or popularity and focus on individuals who demonstrate kindness, hard work, and a commitment to making a difference in the world. Parents can also lead by example, embodying the qualities they want their children to admire in others. Additionally, they can expose their children to a variety of role models through books, documentaries, and community activities, giving them a broader perspective on what makes someone truly admirable.<br><br>
