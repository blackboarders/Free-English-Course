</div><br>

<b>Sample Answer</b><br><br>

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of households in the UK that owned a car from 1971 to 2007. The chart categorizes the data into four groups: households with no car, one car, two cars, and three or more cars.<br><br>

Overall, there was a significant increase in car ownership over the period. In 1971, the majority of households (almost 50%) did not own a car, whereas by 2007, this figure had dropped dramatically to just over 25%. Conversely, the percentage of households owning one car rose steadily from around 35% in 1971 to nearly 45% in 2007, making it the most common scenario by the end of the period.<br><br>

The most noticeable change, however, was in the number of households owning two cars, which more than doubled from approximately 10% in 1971 to nearly 25% in 2007. Additionally, the percentage of households with three or more cars, though always the smallest group, saw a gradual rise from around 1% in 1971 to about 7% in 2007.<br><br>

In conclusion, the data indicates a clear trend towards increased car ownership in the UK over the 36-year period, with one-car and two-car households becoming increasingly prevalent.<br><br><hr>



&bull; General Example: <br>
You are moving to a new city for work and need to find accommodation. Write a letter to a real estate agent in the new city. In your letter, introduce yourself, describe the type of accommodation you need, and ask for advice on suitable neighborhoods.<br><br>


<b>Sample Answer</b><br><br>

Dear Mr. Smith,<br><br>

My name is John Doe, and I am relocating to London next month for a new job opportunity. I am writing to seek your assistance in finding suitable accommodation in the city.<br><br>

I am looking for a one-bedroom apartment, ideally furnished, as I am planning to stay long-term. My preference is for a modern, well-maintained building with good security. It would be great if the apartment is close to public transportation, as I will be commuting to work daily. Additionally, access to local amenities such as supermarkets, gyms, and restaurants is important to me.<br><br>

Since I am not very familiar with the different neighborhoods in London, I would appreciate your advice on which areas might be the best fit for my requirements. I am looking for a safe, vibrant community that offers a good balance between urban convenience and a peaceful living environment.<br><br>

Please let me know if you have any listings that match my criteria or if you need further information from me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br><br>

Thank you for your assistance.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
John Doe<br><br>

Some people think that children should start learning a foreign language at a very young age. Others believe that it is better to wait until they are older. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.<br><br>

<b>Sample Answer</b><br><br>

The question of when children should start learning a foreign language is a topic of debate. Some people argue that the earlier children begin, the better, while others believe that waiting until they are older is more beneficial. This essay will examine both perspectives before presenting my own view.<br><br>

On the one hand, proponents of early language learning argue that young children are more adept at picking up new languages. They point out that children’s brains are highly receptive during their early years, which makes it easier for them to absorb new vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar rules. Furthermore, starting early allows children to develop a more native-like accent and pronunciation, which can be more challenging to achieve later in life. Additionally, learning a language at a young age can be integrated into play and daily activities, making the process more enjoyable and less stressful.<br><br>

On the other hand, some people believe that it is better to wait until children are older before introducing a foreign language. They argue that older children have a better grasp of their first language, which provides a solid foundation for learning a second one. Moreover, older students are typically more motivated and can understand abstract concepts, which are often necessary for mastering a new language. They are also better at managing the demands of language learning alongside their other academic responsibilities.<br><br>

In my opinion, while there are benefits to both approaches, I believe that starting language learning at a young age is more advantageous. The early exposure to a foreign language can provide a strong foundation and make it easier for children to become proficient as they grow older. However, it is also important to ensure that the learning process is age-appropriate and enjoyable to avoid causing any undue stress.<br><br>

In conclusion, both early and later language learning have their merits. Nevertheless, the natural linguistic abilities of young children and the long-term benefits of early exposure make it preferable to begin learning a foreign language at a young age.<br><br>
